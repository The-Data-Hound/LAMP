POSITIVE	Hence, the P. polymyxa levansucrase null mutant has potential for use as an industrial biocatalyst for a cost-effective large-scale 2,3-BD fermentation process devoid of EPS-related challenges.IMPORTANCE Given the current barrage of attention and research investments toward the production of next-generation fuels and chemicals, of which 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) produced by nonpathogenic Paenibacillus species is perhaps one of the most vigorously pursued, tools for engineering Paenibacillus species are intensely sought after.
NEGATIVE	The results presented here demonstrate that inactivation of the levansucrase gene in P. polymyxa leads to diminished EPS accumulation.
POSITIVE	Additionally, a new method for an EPS assay and a simple protocol employing protoplasts for enhanced transformation of P. polymyxa were developed.
NEGATIVE	Overall, although our study shows that levan is not the only EPS produced by P. polymyxa,  it represents a significant first step toward developing cost-effective 2,3-BD fermentation devoid of EPS-associated complications during downstream processing.

NEGATIVE	S. gordonii increased C. albicans survival and filamentation within macrophage phagosomes, while P. aeruginosa reduced fungal survival and filamentation.
NEGATIVE	Coinfection with S. gordonii resulted in greater escape of C. albicans from macrophages and increased size of fungal microcolonies formed on macrophage monolayers, while coinfection with P. aeruginosa reduced macrophage escape and produced smaller microcolonies.
NEGATIVE	S. gordonii cells, as well as S. gordonii heat-fixed culture supernatants, increased C. albicans microcolony biomass but also resulted in microcolony detachment.
POSITIVE	A heat-resistant, trypsin-sensitive pheromone processed by S. gordonii Eep was needed for these effects.
NEGATIVE	The majority of fungal microcolonies formed on human epithelial monolayers with S. gordonii supernatants developed as large floating structures with no detectable invasion of epithelium, along with reduced gene expression of C. albicans HYR1, EAP1, and HWP2 adhesins.
NEGATIVE	However, a subset of C.  albicans microcolonies was smaller and had greater epithelial invasiveness compared to microcolonies grown without S. gordonii Thus, bacteria can alter the  killing and escape of C. albicans from macrophages and contribute to changes in C. albicans pathogenicity.IMPORTANCE Candida albicans is the predominant fungus colonizing the oral cavity that can have both synergistic and antagonistic interactions with other bacteria.
NEGATIVE	We demonstrated that secreted molecules of S. gordonii and P. aeruginosa alter C. albicans survival within the phagosome of macrophages  and alter fungal pathogenic phenotypes, including filamentation and microcolony formation.

NEGATIVE	In this study, we used rat models with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induced by a high fat and sucrose diet and low-dose streptozotocin, respectively, and we evaluated the effect of E. hirae WEHI01 on glycolipid metabolism, glycolipid-related gene expression, organ histopathology, and intestinal flora changes in the 2 models.
NEGATIVE	Our results showed that administration of 5.0 × 109 cfu  of E. hirae WEHI01 for 4 wk decreased serum lipid levels and regulated glycolipid metabolism in the liver of obese rats.
NEGATIVE	Following continuous administration of the same concentration of E. hirae WEHI01 to a T2DM rat model for another 5 wk, E. hirae WEHI01 improved glucose tolerance, recovered body weight loss, and led to significant decreases in tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-10, and total bile acid in serum.
NEGATIVE	We also found that E. hirae WEHI01 restored the morphology of the  pancreas, kidney, and liver, and changed the composition of the gut microbiota (i.e., decreased the Shannon index, increased the Simpson index, and substantially increased the abundance of Lactobacillales).
NEGATIVE	Combining the results  for the obese model and the T2DM model, we speculated that beneficial effects of  E. hirae WEHI01 on T2DM could be due to (1) a significant increase in PPARA expression and a tendency for increased CYP7A1 expression in the liver of obese rats, promoting the conversion of cholesterol into bile acid and reducing serum total bile acid levels in T2DM model rats; or (2) a change in gut microbial diversity, especially elevated Lactobacillales abundance, which reduced the total bile acid in T2DM model rats.

NEGATIVE	Effect of Oral Administration of Weissella confusa on Fecal and Plasma Ethanol Concentrations, Lipids and Glucose Metabolism in Wistar Rats Fed High Fructose and Fat Diet.
NEGATIVE	Background and Purpose: In previous investigations, Weissella confusa was shown to lack the metabolic pathway from fructose to mannitol and to produce ethanol when cultivated in the presence of fructose.
NEGATIVE	Hence, we assessed the effect of oral administration of W. confusa (strain NRRL-B-14171) on blood and fecal ethanol concentrations, glucose and lipid metabolism and traits of the metabolic  syndrome in Wistar rats (n=27) fed diets with two different fat and fructose levels and with or without the addition of W. confusa during a total intervention time of 15 weeks (105 days).
NEGATIVE	Materials and Methods: From week 1 to 6, rats were given a medium fructose and fat (MFru-MF) diet containing 28% fructose and 10% fat without the addition of W. confusa (control group, n=13) or mixed with 30 g per kg diet of lyophilized W. confusa (10.56 ± 0.20 log CFU/g; W. confusa group, n=14).

NEGATIVE	E. coli induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome associated with increased expression of NLRP3, ASC, and cleaved caspase-1, however, L. johnsonii L531 inhibited E. coli-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.
NEGATIVE	Up-regulation of interleukin (Il)-1β, Il-6, Il-8, Il-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and chemokine Cxcl2 expression after E. coli infection was attenuated by L. johnsonii L531.
NEGATIVE	E. coli infection inhibited autophagy, whereas L. johnsonii L531 reversed the inhibitory effect of E. coli on autophagy by decreasing the expression of autophagic receptor SQSTM1/p62 and increasing the expression of autophagy-related proteins ATG5, ATG16L1, and light chain 3 protein by Western blotting analysis.
NEGATIVE	Our findings suggest that L. johnsonii L531 pretreatment restricts NLRP3 inflammasome activity and induces autophagy through promoting ATG5/ATG16L1-mediated autophagy, thereby protecting against E. coli-induced inflammation and cell damage in PMECs.
NEGATIVE	DNT was found to enable high level colonization of the nasal cavity of pigs by B. bronchiseptica and the capacity of DNT to inhibit differentiation of nasal turbinate bone osteoblasts causes atrophic rhinitis in infected pigs.

NEGATIVE	Host Akkermansia muciniphila Abundance Correlates With Gulf War Illness Symptom Persistence via NLRP3-Mediated Neuroinflammation and Decreased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.
NEGATIVE	The results showed that exposure to GW chemicals (the pesticide permethrin and prophylactic drug pyridostigmine bromide) resulted in persistent pathology characterized by the low relative abundance of the probiotic bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut, which correlated with high circulatory HMGB1  levels, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, neuroinflammation and lowered neurotrophin BDNF levels.
NEGATIVE	This suggests that a persistently low species abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and associated chronic inflammation due to inflammasome activation might be playing a significant role in contributing to chronic neurological problems in GWI.
NEGATIVE	The amplicon sequencing analysis revealed typical CT-SIB, such as Lachnospiraceae-like bacteria, and EY-SIB, such as Allobaculum-, Lactobacillus murinus-, and Bacteroides vulgatus-like bacteria.

NEGATIVE	At all conditions tested, a greater resistance to PAA was registered for C. globosum, followed by T. bacillisporus, A. hiratsukae, A. brasiliensis and B. atrophaeus.
NEGATIVE	D-values of C. globosum varied from 23 to 68 min, whereas T. bacillisporus showed D-values from 83 to 352 s and A. hiratsukae showed D-values from 32 to 65 s. Surprisingly, both test microorganisms (A. brasiliensis and B. atrophaeus) proved less resistant than ascospore-forming molds tested, their D-values being always lower than 30 s. Cells treated without a supporting material proved more resistant than those deposited on plastic or metallic strips, with the exception  of tin-plate, where results approaching those obtained without a supporting materials were obtained.

POSITIVE	Here, we obtained a human-derived strain, Lactobacillus mucosae A1, which was shown by metagenomic analysis to be promoted by a high-fiber diet and associated with the amelioration of host hyperlipidemia, and validated its effect on treating hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis as well as changing structure of gut microbiota in ApoE-/- mice on a Western diet.
NEGATIVE	L. mucosae A1 attenuated the severe lipid accumulation in serum, liver and aortic sinus of ApoE-/- mice on a Western diet, while it also reduced the serum lipopolysaccharide-binding protein content of mice, reflecting  the improved metabolic endotoxemia.
NEGATIVE	In addition, L. mucosae A1 shifted the gut microbiota structure of ApoE-/- mice on a Western diet, including recovering a few members of gut microbiota enhanced by the Western diet.
NEGATIVE	This study not only suggests the potential of L. mucosae A1 to be a probiotic in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, but also highlights the advantage of such function-based rather than taxonomy-based strategies for the selection of candidate strains for the next generation probiotics.
NEGATIVE	[Epub ahead of print]  Short communication: Genome-wide identification of new reference genes for reverse-transcription quantitative PCR in Streptococcus thermophilus based on RNA-sequencing analysis.
NEGATIVE	Streptococcus thermophilus, one of the most important industrial lactic acid bacteria, is widely used for the production of fermented dairy products such as yogurt and cheese.

NEGATIVE	With rates of community-associated Clostridium difficile infection (CA-CDI) increasing worldwide, potential reservoirs/sources of C. difficile in the community are being sought.
NEGATIVE	Since C. difficile is found in animal manure and human biosolids which are composted for agricultural purposes, composted products could be a source.
NEGATIVE	In this study, the presence of C. difficile in composted products, and their genetic relatedness to other previously isolated strains from humans, root vegetables and the environment in Western Australia, was investigated.
NEGATIVE	Overall, C. difficile was found in 22.5% (16/71) of composted products [29.7% (11/37) of soil conditioners, 16.7% (2/12) of mulches and 13.6% (3/22) of garden mixes].
NEGATIVE	Fifteen C. difficile PCR ribotypes (RTs) were identified, the most common toxigenic strains being RTs 020 and 056.
NEGATIVE	C. difficile RT 056 is commonly associated with CDI in humans and has also been isolated from  cattle, root vegetables and the environment (veterinary clinics and lawn) in Australia.

NEGATIVE	In present study, the effects of strain Pseudomonas chlororaphis PAS18, a kind of PGPR enable to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), on the growth and physiological responses of Pennisetum americanum (L.) K.Schum seedlings were investigated under three different levels (0, 20 and 100 mg kg-1) of atrazine in  pot experiment.
NEGATIVE	It is closely related to S. hyicus and S. chromogenes, hence infections caused by S. agnetis may be misdiagnosed or  even undiagnosed.
NEGATIVE	Bacterial endospores of the apathogenic species of  the genus Bacillus Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus were used.
NEGATIVE	We included 4,858 isolates (59%, 36%, and 5% due to Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and other Enterococcus spp., respectively).

NEGATIVE	Tyrosine tRNA synthetase as a novel extracellular immunomodulatory protein in Streptococcus anginosus.
NEGATIVE	Streptococcus anginosus is frequently detected in patients with infective endocarditis, abscesses or oral cancer.
NEGATIVE	Although S. anginosus is considered the causative pathogen of these diseases, the pathogenic mechanisms of the bacterium  have remained unclear.
NEGATIVE	Previously, we suggested that an extracellular antigen from S. anginosus (SAA) serves as a pathogenic factor by inducing nitric oxide production in murine macrophages.
NEGATIVE	SAA was identified as a tyrosine tRNA synthetase (SaTyrRS) that was isolated from the extracellular fraction of S. anginosus but not from other oral streptococci.
NEGATIVE	Consequently, these results indicated that SaTyrRS could be a novel and specific immunomodulatory protein in S. anginosus.
POSITIVE	The relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Blautia, Parabacteroides, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis and Prevotella stercorea was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in patients with AD than healthy control subjects.

POSITIVE	The results of phylogenetic, biochemical and chemotaxonomic  characterisation allow the differentiation of strain 18JY15-6T from N. phosphati  WYH11-7T, M. terrae JOS5-1T and N. jensenii NBRC 14755T which supports the conclusion that this strain represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides, for which we propose the name Nocardioides jejuensis sp.
POSITIVE	Enrichment of Oxalobacter formigenes, Sutterella wadsworthensis, and Bacteroides pectinophilus was significantly observed in controls, whereas enrichment of Collinsella aerofaciens, Gemella morbillorum, and Veillonella parvula Actinobacteria was observed significantly in the IBS cohort.
POSITIVE	Here, we studied EctB from the thermo-tolerant Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus lautus (Pl) and show that this tetrameric enzyme is highly tolerant to salt, pH, and temperature.
NEGATIVE	Inspection of the genomic context of the ectB gene in P. lautus identifies an unusual arrangement of juxtapositioned genes for ectoine biosynthesis and import via an Ehu-type binding-protein-dependent ABC transporter.

POSITIVE	Bacillus halodurans OapB forms a high-affinity complex with the P13 region of the noncoding RNA OLE.
POSITIVE	The temperature of growth and sporulation modulates the efficiency of spore-display in Bacillus subtilis.
NEGATIVE	Two main strategies have been developed to display heterologous molecules on the surface of Bacillus subtilis spores: (i) a recombinant approach, based on the construction of a gene fusion between a gene coding for a coat protein (carrier) and DNA coding for the protein to be displayed, and (ii) a non-recombinant approach, based on the spontaneous and stable adsorption of heterologous molecules on the spore surface.
POSITIVE	It has been recently shown that B. subtilis builds structurally and functionally different spores when grown at different temperatures; based on this finding B. subtilis spores prepared at 25, 37 or 42 °C were compared for their efficiency in displaying various model proteins by either the recombinant or the non-recombinant approach.
NEGATIVE	There was a non-significant trend of increased diversity with urbanization, with a few taxa found overrepresented in urban Amerindians (Brevibacterium linens and Peptoniphilus lacrimalis) or mestizos (Mobiluncus mulieris and Prevotella sp.).
POSITIVE	Five mesocosm experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of mussels in filtering the total bacteria and Aeromonas hydrophila, as well as their clearance efficiency on trout farm wastewater.
POSITIVE	The net reduction of the total bacterial concentration was as much as 72%, while that of A. hydrophila reached a level of 95-98%.
POSITIVE	The efficiency of freshwater bivalves in reducing the bacterial load, in particular toward A. hydrophila, indicates a bioremediation system with  the possibility of interesting applications on inland fish farms, and as a biotechnological tool against the diffusion of antibiotic resistance in aquaculture.
NEGATIVE	These included four isolates belonging to Aeromonas spp., one Acinetobacter beijerinckii isolate and one Morganella morganii isolate.
NEGATIVE	A. salmonicida and Acinetobacter beijerinckii carried new variants of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) such as β-lactamases and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (catB), whereas Morganella morganii carried several clinically relevant ARGs.
NEGATIVE	Our study shows that marine plastics carry not  only potentially virulent fish pathogens but also multidrug resistant opportunistic human pathogens like M. morganii and may serve as vectors for transport of these pathogens in the marine environment.
NEGATIVE	Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis infections are a public health concern and cost the United States' healthcare system 16 billion dollars annually.
POSITIVE	Contribution of different adherent properties of Granulicatella adiacens and Abiotrophia defectiva to their associations with oral colonization and the risk of infective endocarditis.
NEGATIVE	Granulicatella adiacens (G. adiacens) and Abiotrophia defectiva (A. defectiva) colonize the oral cavity and form part of the normal flora in the intestinal and  genitourinary tracts.
NEGATIVE	As reported previously, the frequency of isolation of G. adiacens from the oral cavity was much higher than that of A. defectiva.
NEGATIVE	However, it has been reported that compared with G. adiacens, A. defectiva was isolated at considerably higher frequencies from the blood of patients with infective endocarditis (IE).
NEGATIVE	Hence, in this study, the in vitro interaction of G. adiacens  and A. defectiva strains with host surfaces and biofilm formation was examined to assess whether their different adhesive properties contribute to their associations with oral colonization and IE, respectively.
NEGATIVE	Conversely, A. defectiva displayed significantly greater adherence to human umbilical vein endothelial cells and immobilized fibronectin than G. adiacens.
NEGATIVE	These findings suggest that differences in binding  properties to host components imply specific binding mechanisms in G. adiacens and A. defectiva, which might mediate selective colonization in the oral cavity or are associated with the pathogenicity of endocarditis.
NEGATIVE	Skipped vertebral spontaneous spondylodiscitis caused by Granulicatella adiacens: Case report and a systematic literature review.

NEGATIVE	intermedius', and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, only require V-factor.
NEGATIVE	Our results suggest that the common ancestor of modern-day H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae lost key haemin biosynthesis loci, likely as a consequence of specialized adaptation to otorhinolaryngeal and respiratory niches during their divergence from H. parainfluenzae.
POSITIVE	Genetic similarity analysis demonstrated that the haemin biosynthesis loci acquired in the hiHh lineage were  likely laterally transferred from a H. parainfluenzae ancestor, and that this event probably occurred only once in hiHh.
POSITIVE	At the species level, the abundances of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter segnis, Capnocytophaga leadbetteri, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, and another five species were significantly increased, suggesting a potential association between these bacteria and OSCC.
NEGATIVE	Bacterial taxa positively correlated with pig growth (Lactobacillus kisonensis in the ileum and  Roseburia faecis in the caecum) were more abundant in pigs fed ENZ diets, whereas most of the ileal bacterial taxa negatively correlated with growth (Megasphaera,  Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus) had lower abundance in pigs fed Cferm diets.
NEGATIVE	This strain triggers formation of a precipitate ("white line") when cocultured with Pseudomonas tolaasii However, LMG 1272 lacks  the capacity to produce a cyclic lipopeptide that is typically associated with white line formation, suggesting the involvement of a different diffusible factor.

NEGATIVE	Serratia marcescens showed the highest mortality percentage of 68% and 54% at bacterial concentration of 109 CFU ml-1 via oral-contact and contact method, respectively.
NEGATIVE	Serratia marcescens was also defined as the bacteria with the highest ability to induce the high mortality of  C. curvignathus with the lowest concentration of bacterial suspension at a given  time under laboratory condition.
POSITIVE	The results of this study indicate that P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens in particular may be attractive candidates worth further examination as a possible biocontrol agent against C. curvignathus in the field and to evaluate environmental and ecological risks of the biocontrol.
NEGATIVE	This case describes a 69-year-old man who hematogenously spread C. septicum without associated malignancy, subsequently failed conservative management in the form of intravenous antibiotics, and was definitively treated with surgical intervention through a minimally invasive approach.

POSITIVE	We assessed the functionality of several innate immunity receptors, IL-12 receptor, and IFN-γ receptor, as well as the antioxidant levels (glutathione), which are essential mechanisms for fighting intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis.
NEGATIVE	Results: Two carbohydrate esterases with similar architectures, each comprising two distinct physically linked catalytic domains from families 1 (CE1) and 6 (CE6), were selected from xylan-targeting polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs)  encoded by the Bacteroidetes species Bacteroides ovatus and Flavobacterium johnsoniae.
POSITIVE	Interestingly, a significant improvement in xylanase biomass degradation was observed following  addition of the full-length multidomain enzyme from B. ovatus versus the addition of its two separated single domains, indicating an intramolecular synergy between the esterase domains.
NEGATIVE	Despite high sequence similarities between the esterase domains from B. ovatus and F. johnsoniae, their addition to the xylanolytic reaction led to different degradation patterns.
NEGATIVE	We also found one case of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Ochrobactrum tritici, Bacillus sonorensis and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) colonization.
NEGATIVE	CFTR Depletion Confers Hypersusceptibility to Mycobacterium fortuitum in a Zebrafish Model.
NEGATIVE	The Mycobacterium fortuitum complex comprises several closely related species, causing pulmonary and extra-pulmonary infections.
NEGATIVE	However, there is very limited  knowledge about the disease pathogenesis involved in M. fortuitum infections, particularly due to the lack of suitable animal models.
NEGATIVE	Using the zebrafish model, we show that embryos are susceptible to M. fortuitum infection in a dose-dependent manner.
NEGATIVE	The formation of extracellular cords in infected embryos highlights a previously unknown pathogenic feature of M. fortuitum.
NEGATIVE	Moreover, transient macrophage depletion led to rapid  embryo death with increased extracellular cords, indicating that macrophages are  essential determinants of M. fortuitum infection control.
NEGATIVE	There was a noticeable decrease in the number of cftr-deficient infected embryos with granulomas as compared to infected controls, suggesting that loss of CFTR leads to impaired host immune responses and confers hypersusceptiblity to M. fortuitum infection.
POSITIVE	Overall, these findings highlight the application of the zebrafish embryo to study M. fortuitum and emphasizes previously unexplored aspects of disease pathogenesis of this significant mycobacterial species.
POSITIVE	eCollection 2019 Nov.  Corynebacterium pacaense sp.
NEGATIVE	Here we describe the basic characteristics of Corynebacterium pacaense strain Marseille-P2417T (= CSUR P2417), Alistipes megaguti strain Marseille-P5997T (= CSUR P5997) and Alistipes provencensis strain Marseille-P2431T (= CSUR P2431 = DSM 102308).
NEGATIVE	High-Titer Lactic Acid Production by Pediococcus acidilactici PA204 from Corn Stover through Fed-Batch Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation.
POSITIVE	In this study, Pediococcus acidilactici PA204  is a lactic acid bacterium with a high tolerance of temperature and high-efficiency utilization of xylose.
NEGATIVE	A whole-cell Lactococcus garvieae autovaccine protects Nile tilapia against infection.
POSITIVE	Significantly less L. garvieae (p<0.03) was re-isolated from either the adjuvant  only or control groups compared to the vaccinated group.
POSITIVE	Furthermore, a significantly high amount (p<0.001) of anti-L. garvieae specific antibodies were  observed in the vaccinated group compared to the adjuvant only or control groups  at time of challenge.
NEGATIVE	This coincided with protection against infection measured by absence/reduced L. garvieae re-isolation from internal organs, reduced clinical signs and lack of pathology in this group.
NEGATIVE	The findings suggest that oil-based vaccines can protect tilapia against L. garvieae infection through an antibody mediated response.
NEGATIVE	Staphylococcus equorum S2M7, Staphylococcus xylosus CECT7057, Lactobacillus sakei CV3C2, Lactobacillus sakei CECT7056 and a yeast strain (2RB4) were co-inoculated in meat batters at defined concentrations.
NEGATIVE	eCollection 2019 Dec.  Enzymatic hydrolysis of Opuntia ficus-indica cladode by Acinetobacter pittii and  alcohol fermentation by Kluyveromyces marxianus: pH, temperature and microorganism effect.
NEGATIVE	Two wild microorganisms  were used, Acinetobacter pittii a bacteria isolated from decaying cladodes, and Kluyveromyces marxianus a yeast isolated from termite stomach.
POSITIVE	The maximum hydrolytic activities were obtained with Acinetobacter pittii at 37 °C and pH 6.5 for total cellulases (0.67 ± 0.02 IU/ml) and for endoglucanases (0.23 ± 0.02 IU/ml) at 24 and 4 h. The maximum production of alcohol was 12.98 ± 0.06 g/L obtained with Kluyveromyces marxianus at 4 h with conditions of 40 °C and pH 5.5.
NEGATIVE	[Epub ahead of print]  Staphylococcus aureus Second Immunoglobulin-Binding Protein drives atopic dermatitis via IL-33.
NEGATIVE	BACKGROUND: S. aureus is the dominant infective trigger of atopic dermatitis (AD).
POSITIVE	OBJECTIVE: To identify the S. aureus-derived virulence factor(s) that initiates the cutaneous type 2-promoting immune response responsible for AD.
NEGATIVE	METHODS: In vitro human keratinocyte cell culture, ex vivo human skin organ explants and the eczema prone Nc/Tnd mouse were used as model systems to assess type-2 promoting immune responses to S. aureus.
NEGATIVE	Bioactivity was confirmed by cloning and expression in an E. coli vector system, and S. aureus Sbi mutant strains confirming loss of activity.
POSITIVE	RESULTS: S. aureus was unique amongst staphylococcal species in its ability to induce the rapid release of constitutive IL-33 from human keratinocytes independent of the toll-like receptor pathway.
NEGATIVE	Using the eczema-prone NC/Tnd mouse model, we showed that IL-33 was essential in inducing the immune response to S. aureus in vivo.
POSITIVE	CONCLUSION: S. aureus-derived Sbi is a unique type 2-promoting virulence factor capable of initiating the type-2 promoting cytokine activity underlying AD.
NEGATIVE	CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The Second Immunoglobulin-Binding Protein (Sbi) produced solely by S. aureus species, is an important factor inducing type-2 promoting cytokine responses and atopic dermatitis.
POSITIVE	[Epub ahead of print]  Identification of novel vaccine candidates against carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae: A systematic reverse proteomic approach.
NEGATIVE	Klebsiella pneumoniae is declared as antibiotic resistant by WHO, with the critical urgency of developing novel antimicrobial therapeutics as drug resistance is the second most dangerous threat after terrorism.
NEGATIVE	Besides many attempts still, there is no effective vaccine available against K. pneumoniae.
NEGATIVE	The study shows that the potential vaccine targets are sufficiently efficient being virulent, of outer membranous origin and can be proposed for the  DNA third-generation vaccines development that would help to cope up infections caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.
NEGATIVE	The slicing was the most critical step, shaping two general types of microbiota according to the slicing line: one dominated by Carnobacterium divergens and another one dominated by Leuconostoc carnosum and Serratia proteamaculans.
NEGATIVE	Draft Genome Sequence of Actinomyces neuii UMB1295, Isolated from the Female Urinary Tract.
NEGATIVE	Actinomyces neuii is an opportunistic pathogen.
NEGATIVE	Here, we investigate a draft genome sequence of A. neuii UMB1295, which was isolated from a catheterized urine sample from a woman with a urinary tract infection.
