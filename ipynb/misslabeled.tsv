Although S. anginosus is considered the causative pathogen of these diseases, the pathogenic mechanisms of the bacterium  have remained unclear.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
The cations, metals, and natural organic matter (NOM) in the runoff water contributed to equalizing the zeta potential values for Dugway B. globigii and B. thuringiensis  kurstaki, and drastically modified the surface of the concrete and asphalt.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
intermedius', and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, only require V-factor.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to obtain a 7.6-fold increase of  exopolysaccharide (EPS) 58.1 ± 0.4 g/L produced by Leuconostoc lactis L2 under the condition of sucrose 91.2 g/L, pH 5.8 and NaAc 1.2 g/L.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
To enhance the PVK degradation ability of PVK, a whole-cell biodegradation process of Ochrobactrum tritici X-2 was established and optimized.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
A recent conceptual model implicates three main bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis; Atopobium vaginae; and Prevotella bivia), sexual activity, sialidase activity, and biofilm  formation in the pathogenesis of BV.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Experiments in a mouse model recapitulated the ability of recovery-associated bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) to promote recovery with synergistic effects, providing a boost of two orders of magnitude to microbial abundance in early time points and faster maturation of microbial diversity.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Rapid Increase of CTX-M-Producing Shigella sonnei Isolates in Switzerland Due to  Spread of Common Plasmids and International Clones.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
eCollection 2019 Dec.  Enzymatic hydrolysis of Opuntia ficus-indica cladode by Acinetobacter pittii and  alcohol fermentation by Kluyveromyces marxianus: pH, temperature and microorganism effect.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Comparative analysis of microbial community structure between healthy and Aeromonas veronii-infected Yangtze finless porpoise.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Strain sets of L. curvatus and L. sakei were employed as starters in a fermented sausage model and their abundancy upon fermentation was determined by strain-specific MALDI-TOF MS identification.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
In vitro antibacterial and cellular experiments showed that S. aureus growth, biofilm formation, and induction of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-6 secretion from HaCaT cells were significantly inhibited by Klebsiella oxytoca, Kocuria rhizophila, and Staphylococcus epidermidis culture supernatants (p < 0.05).	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Antagonistic activity by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain GCC_19W2, P. aeruginosa strain GCC_19W3 and strains of Achromobacter restricts the growth of other microorganisms by producing some bactericidal substances.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
An exopolysaccharide (EPS) producer slimy-mucoid type colony was isolated from sourdough and identified as Weissella cibaria MED17.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
C. minuta was later shown in one study to be part of the most heritable taxonomic group in the  human gut microbiome and to be enriched in people with low body mass index (BMI).	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"The results confirm the presence of multi-antibiotic-resistant Aeromonas caviae strains with virulence properties as  ""high-risk isolates"" in treated wastewater."	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
These data also update the molecular phylogeny of C. sordellii, indicating a possible pathogenic  clade in the environment that is distinct from currently identified clades.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
The Antibacterial Activity and Mechanism of Action of Luteolin Against Trueperella pyogenes.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Finally, the alcohol aldehyde dehydrogenase gene adhE1 from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was introduced into the strain to enable butanol production at low pH, in coordination with solvent fermentation of C. beijerinckii in consortium.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The B. cereus 0-9 genome also encodes a YmdB-like protein, which has measureable phosphodiesterase activity, and 72.35% sequence identity to YmdB protein of B. subtilis 168.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
The potential for inoculating Lactobacillus animalis and Enterococcus faecium alone or in combination using commercial in ovo technology without negatively impacting hatch and post-hatch performance.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
